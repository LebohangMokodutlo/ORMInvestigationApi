Data Access: Employs Dapper ORM for efficient SQL query execution and command handling.
Configuration: Leverages IConfiguration for flexible management of application settings.

CRUD Operations: Provides methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting user records.
SQL Interaction: Directly interacts with the database using SQL queries for data manipulation.
Dependency Injection: Implements dependency injection for DataContextDapper and other services.

EF Core:
